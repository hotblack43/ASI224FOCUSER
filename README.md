# ASI224FOCUSER

1) The ASI224 camera from ZWO can be focused by twisting the lens in its thread-mount. In case your camera is mounted in an unacessible place you may wish to be able to focus it remotely. This is my project to enable that.

2) In this project, the camera is connected by USB to an online Raspberry Pi (3B+ in my case) and by logging on to that Raspberry over the internet I can go to a terminal and there issue commands to take images as well as run a python code which I am distributing in this Github, which allows turning of the lens in its thread by use of a geared stepper-motor and a cog-wheel mounted around the lens.

3) The project files consist of two OPENSCAD files (in .scad format so you can edit and make them better) and one python (3) code which, when installed with the right liraries, as well as various enabling electronics, allows turning the lens left or right by so many steps.

4) So far, that's all there is - plenty of questions about the extra electronics needed can be given but a description is only now being prepared and will be uploaded when possible.

5) Questions can be sent to me at peter.thejll@gmail.com
